  	<h2>Euro 2020 postponed until summer 2021; domestic leagues, UEFA competitions to be completed by June 30</h2>
  	<p>UEFA has postponed Euro 2020 until the summer of 2021 amid the coronavirus pandemic, with a commitment to complete European leagues and UEFA competitions by June 30.

	The news was first confirmed by the Norwegian FA on social media, with UEFA later proposing the competition will be played between June 11 and July 11, 2021.</p>

	<p>Those dates were unanimously confirmed during a FIFA Council conference call on Wednesday and included on the 2021 calendar along with new dates for Copa America. A decision over the FIFA Club World Cup, scheduled to take place during that window, will be taken at a later date.</p>

	<p>The playoffs for Euro 2020, which will include the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, have also been postponed.</p>

	<p>The semi-finals were originally set to take place on March 26 with the finals on March 31. Those fixtures have instead now been postponed until June.</p>

	<p>UEFA said in a statement: "UEFA today announced the postponement of its flagship national team competition, UEFA Euro 2020, due to be played in June and July this year.</p>

	<blockquote>"The health of all those involved in the game is the priority, as well as to avoid placing any unnecessary pressure on national public services involved in staging matches. The move will help all domestic competitions, currently on hold due to the COVID-19 emergency, to be completed.</blockquote>

	<blockquote>"All UEFA competitions and matches (including friendlies) for clubs and national teams for both men and women have been put on hold until further notice.</blockquote>

	<blockquote>"The UEFA Euro 2020 Play-off matches and international friendlies, scheduled for the end of March, will now be played in the international window at the start of June, subject to a review of the situation.

	"A working group has been set up with the participation of leagues and club representatives to examine calendar solutions that would allow for the completion of the current season and any other consequence of the decisions made today."
	</blockquote>

	<p>Domestic competitions across Europe were due to be finished before Euro 2020, which was to be held in 12 different cities, began on June 12.

	However, leagues across the continent have been halted in response to the coronavirus outbreak, which has seen more than 169,000 people become infected around the world.</p>

	<p>UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin admitted the decision to postpone Euro 2020 by 12 months would be costly for UEFA but said he is determined that funding for grassroots football in its 55 member nations would not be affected by it</p>

	<blockquote>"Moving EURO 2020 comes at a huge cost for UEFA but we will do our best to ensure that the vital funding for grassroots, women's football and the development of the game in our 55 countries is not affected. Purpose over profit has been our guiding principle in taking this decision for the good of European football as a whole."</blockquote>
