    <h2>What is the European Premier League? The Fifa-backed league supported by Liverpool, Man Utd and Barcelona</h2>

    <img src="images/Prem2.jpg">

    <p>The proposal could have dramatic consequences for the Champions League, while Arsene Wenger warns it could ‘destroy’ the Premier League</p>

    <p>Liverpool and Manchester United are reportedly in favour of a new Fifa-run “European Premier League” featuring some of the biggest clubs on the continent, with Barcelona recently adding their support as well.</p>

    <p>According to Sky News, Wall Street bank JP Morgan have assembled a $6bn (£4.6bn) funding package for the creation of the super league-style competetion which if successful, would have dramatic consequences for the Uefa Champions League, major domestic leagues including the Premier League and football as a whole.</p>

    <p>In October it was revealed that Liverpool and Manchester United were spearheading “Project Big Picture” which featured plans to revolutionise the finances and structure of English football from the top down.</p>

    <p>Although that plan was voted down by at least 14 Premier League clubs during an emergency meeting, it is apparent that Liverpool, United and potentially other “big six” clubs are eager for major changes to be made to the way European football is run.</p>

    <h2>Which teams could join?</h2>

    <p>So far more than a dozen teams hailing from the “big five” European leagues – the English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, Italian Serie A, German Bundesliga and French Ligue 1 – are said to have held talks about being founding members in a 16 or 18 team competition.</p>

    <p>As many as five Premier League clubs could be involved from the outset and assuming that Liverpool and Manchester United would take up two places, three of the four remaining “big six” clubs – Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Spurs – may also be included.</p>

    <blockquote>A provisional start date has been discussed for as early as 2022 although it is unclear how that would be impacted by the winter World Cup in Qatar which is scheduled to take place between November and December.</blockquote>
    
    <h2>How would it work?</h2>

    <img src="images/Prem3.jpg">

    <p>The European Premier League would be a round-robin tournament with each team playing against each other twice per season in home and away fixtures.

    The top-ranked teams in the league season would then compete in knockout matches. It is so far unclear how many teams that would involve and what the format would be.

    That would mean any team involved would play a minimum of 32 league games in a 16-team league or 36 in an 18-team league.</p>
